The Agora Desktop Environment

Agora is a project to develop a really great GNUstep-based desktop environment, with an incremental development strategy. At present, it builds the base GNUstep environment from our forks of the components, in a shared default configuration. With time and continuous incremental changes, it will develop into a fully-fledged desktop environment familiar to Mac users, but not directly a clone of any version of Mac OS X.

We use forked versions of the GNUstep libraries because our goals require changes which we would not want to ask the main GNUstep project to adopt. We will continue to import code from upstream as it is integrated. We envision the relationship between Agora and GNUstep as being analogous to that between XFCE and GTK+, or KDE and QT -- we are a consumer of the libraries first and foremost, and thus our changes should not necessarily be considered for upstream inclusion.
